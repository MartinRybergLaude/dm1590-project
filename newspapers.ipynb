    "News articles come in a variety of subjects and categories describing their field and relevance. Some of these have self-reported tags, but too many do not, or provide inaccurate tags. Tagging articles has the potential to help information-seekers to judge the relevance of articles and filter them by interest, especially in this day and age where information is so abundant it can be exhausting. In this project we set out to use machine learning to tag articles based on their titles, to aid the effort of searching for relevant information."
